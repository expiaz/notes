# Right triangle

The sum of the angles of a right triangle is ALWAYS equals to 180� !

# Hypethenuse, opposite and adjacent

Hypothenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite to the right angle
+ it's the longest side !

# Pythagore

(Hypothenuse ^ 2) = (Opposite ^ 2) + (Adjancent ^ 2)

With our triangle: AB² = BC² + AC²

# Trigonometry

## sine, cosine and tangent 

works well from 0 up to 90° angles

SOH sin = opposite / hypothenuse
CAH cos = adjacent / hypothenuse
TOA tan = opposite / adjacent
